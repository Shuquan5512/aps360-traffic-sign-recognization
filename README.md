<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Vehicles are the main mode of transport worldwide. Traffic signs prompt drivers to adapt their driving behaviour to ensure they comply with road regulations. Obeying traffic signs is not only essential for drivers but also for other people on the road to prevent the occurrence of casualty accidents[]. It is significant to understand the implication of traffic signs. The goal of this project is to develop a traffic sign recognition system that can help to distinguish the meaning of each traffic sign. 

The importance of this project aims to improve the safety of driving. Traffic signs with useful information will be overlooked in serval situations such as misunderstanding and fatigued driving. Besides, Traffic sign recognition plays an important row in driver-less technology. It can highly support unmanned vehicles to be able to effectively simulate driving behaviour.

Deep learning is a reasonable approach for traffic sign recognition. Traffic signs contain lots of text features, image features and numerical features. It is challenge for algorithms to extract features without devising them artificially. The advantage of deep learning is to extract and generalize these different features automatically to get better results.
